                 Building Open CASCADE Technology on Windows
                 -------------------------------------------

This file describes steps to build OCCT libraries from pre-processed source
(after WOK extraction or from complete source package) on Windows. 

Before building OCCT, you need to install required third-party libraries; see
OCCT_Build3rdParty_Windows.pdf for details.

1. Edit file custom.bat to define environment: 

   VCVER - version of Visual Studio (vc8, vc9, vc10, vc11 or vc12), 
           and relevant VCVARS path
   ARCH - architecture (32 or 64)
   HAVE_* - flags to enable or disable use of optional third-party products
   CSF_OPT_* - paths to search for includes and binaries of all used 
               third-party products

2. Launch msvc.bat to start Visual Studio

3. Build with Visual Studio

Use draw.bat to start DRAW
